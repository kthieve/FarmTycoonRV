- Follow the "minimum viable increment" approach
- Document decisions or questions that arise
- Commit changes frequently with descriptive commit messages

### 3. Post-Session (5 minutes)
- Document progress in the task tracking system
- Update task status
- Record any new ideas in the Ideas system
- Set up the next task if time permits

## Task Management

Tasks are organized in the following categories:
