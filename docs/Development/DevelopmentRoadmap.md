## Implementation Priority Guidelines

When implementing features, follow these priority guidelines:

1. **Core Mechanics First**: Focus on fundamental gameplay systems before adding complexity
2. **Vertical Slice Approach**: Build one complete feature flow before expanding breadth
3. **Test Early, Test Often**: Implement testing throughout development
4. **Polish Incrementally**: Add basic polish as you go rather than leaving it all for the end
5. **Performance Matters**: Consider optimization from the beginning

## Adapting the Roadmap

This roadmap should be treated as a living document. After each milestone:

1. Review progress and adjust timeline if needed
2. Evaluate feature priorities based on implementation experience
3. Consider adding or removing features based on gameplay testing
4. Adjust resource allocation for remaining tasks
