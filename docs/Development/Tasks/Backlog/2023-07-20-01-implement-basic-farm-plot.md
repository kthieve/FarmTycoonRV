# Task: Implement Basic Farm Plot System

## Basic Information
- **ID**: 2023-07-20-01
- **Type**: Feature
- **Estimated Time**: 60 minutes
- **Milestone**: Phase 1 - Farm Plot System
- **Priority**: High

## Description
Create the foundational farm plot system that will be used for crop planting, management, and interaction with tools.

## Objective
Implement a grid-based farm plot system that can track the state of each plot cell and respond to player interactions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Create a visual grid representation of the farm plot
- Implement different states for plot cells (untilled, tilled, watered, etc.)
- Allow basic player interaction with plot cells
- Create visual feedback for different plot states
- Implement basic state transitions (e.g., untilled â†’ tilled)

## Implementation Notes
- Create a `FarmPlot.tscn` scene and `FarmPlot.gd` script
- Use TileMap for visual representation
- Define an enum for plot states
- Implement a 2D array to track plot cell states
- Add collision detection for player interaction
- Consider implementing a state pattern for plot cells

## Dependencies
- Basic player movement system
- Input handling system
- Preliminary art assets for farm plots

## Testing Plan
- Test player movement around the farm plot
- Verify player can interact with plot cells
- Check that visual feedback matches internal state
- Test basic state transitions
- Ensure grid system scales correctly for different farm sizes

## Next Steps
- Implement tool interaction with farm plots
- Add crop planting mechanics
- Implement weather effects on farm plots
- Create advanced plot states (fertilized, flooded, etc.)
