# Crop Quality System

## Summary
A tiered crop quality system that affects prices and enables special recipes/gifts.

## Description
Introduce quality levels for all crops (Poor, Normal, Good, Excellent, Perfect) determined by:
- How well the crop was cared for (watering, fertilizing)
- Soil quality
- Weather conditions during growth
- Seasonal affinity (crops in their ideal season have better quality)
- Player's farming skill level

Higher quality crops sell for more money, are preferred for special orders, and can be used to create better gifts for the shopkeeper. Some recipes or special orders might specifically require high-quality crops.

Quality would be visually indicated by subtle variations in the crop sprite (size, color vibrancy) and clear labeling in the inventory.
