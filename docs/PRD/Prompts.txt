I want to make a game based on the j2me game Farm Tycoon.

First I want to write a documentation and PRD and detailed System for the process of development including all features (keep in files for confirmed and potential which needs to be aproved by me)

Also desine a system which will allow me to gradually develop this game and story by working just 30 mintues and 1 hour focused on it with plans and daily routines. consider development and brainstorming processes

use markdown, svg diagrams, mermaid, tables.

Ask me any questions require.
add suitable features and mehanics and ideas following to the prelude.md (more like a seed file)
make a good process / tool for me to store brainstorm ideas and put proper tags and use catagories like planned, working on, future, selected, and give an idea score


Do as needed

organize in the most userfriendly way
also there should be a documentation and guide for developer and player seperate

ask me any questions as needed
